# `dotfiles`

## Installation

The installation script (and shell setup) requires `zsh`. From your home
directory, run the following to create symlinks in your home directory:

```zsh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/walterl/dotfiles.git
./dotfiles/use.sh
```

This does not install vim plugins. To install them, start vim and execute
`:PlugInstall`.
